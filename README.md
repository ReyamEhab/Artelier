## 🎨 **Artelier – Your Interactive Studio Companion**

### 🧠 **Project Brief**

**Artelier** is a creative, proof-of-concept e-commerce web application designed to make buying art supplies an enjoyable, interactive experience. Instead of a standard online shop, Artelier functions as a digital *atelier* (artist’s workshop), where users can test paint colors on a virtual canvas, preview brush effects, or receive curated art kits based on their goals.

The goal of this project is to combine **artistic creativity** with **modern web technologies** — showcasing frontend and backend development skills while keeping the interface friendly, inspiring, and intuitive.
It targets beginner to intermediate artists, hobbyists, and students who often feel overwhelmed by the large variety of materials. Artelier helps them explore, discover, and purchase what they need — all in one beautiful and interactive environment.
